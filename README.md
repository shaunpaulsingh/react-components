# React components coded from scratch
Author: Shaun Paul Singh
Date: 17/04/2022

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
These are React components that I am creating from scratch. I am writing these for demo purposes.

You'll be able to steal the layouts for now but these components are not really for use "as is" right now.
I'll probably do that in the future. I'm still learning React to be honest.

Right now we have:<br>
1. Form component<br>
2. Gallery component<br>
3. Card component<br>
4. Settings component<br>
4. Login component<br>
5. Dialogue component<br>
6. Accordian component<br>
7. Tag Cloud component<br>

I will add more as we go along.
